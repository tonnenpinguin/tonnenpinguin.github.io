Every developer who's worked with databases has experienced connection failures. Whether it's network issues, database maintenance, or unexpected load spikes, these failures can bring your application to its knees if not handled properly.

In this post, I'll share how I implemented a robust solution for handling PostgreSQL connection failures in a Phoenix application that serves thousands of concurrent users.

## The Problem

Our Phoenix application was experiencing intermittent database connection failures during peak hours. These failures would cascade through the system, causing 500 errors for users and putting unnecessary load on our database when connections were restored.

## The Solution

I implemented a multi-layered approach to handle these failures gracefully:

### 1. Database Connection Pool Configuration

First, I optimized our Ecto configuration for better resilience:

```elixir
# config/config.exs
config :my_app, MyApp.Repo,
  adapter: Ecto.Adapters.Postgres,
  database: "my_app_prod",
  username: "my_app",
  password: "password",
  hostname: "localhost",
  pool_size: 20,              # Increase for high traffic
  pool_timeout: 30_000,       # 30 seconds timeout
  timeout: 30_000,            # Query timeout
  queue_target: 1000,         # Queue queries when pool is full
  queue_interval: 1000,       # Check queue every second
  log: :debug
```

### 2. Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff

I created a retry helper module that implements exponential backoff:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.RetryHelper do
  @max_attempts 5
  @base_delay 100

  def retry(fun, attempts \\ @max_attempts) do
    do_retry(fun, attempts, @base_delay)
  end

  defp do_retry(_fun, 0, _delay) do
    {:error, :max_retries_exceeded}
  end

  defp do_retry(fun, attempts, delay) do
    case fun.() do
      {:ok, result} ->
        {:ok, result}

      {:error, reason} ->
        Logger.warn("Operation failed (#{attempts} attempts left): #{inspect(reason)}")

        :timer.sleep(delay)
        do_retry(fun, attempts - 1, delay * 2)
    end
  end
end
```

### 3. Circuit Breaker Pattern

For operations that might overwhelm a struggling database, I implemented a simple circuit breaker:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.CircuitBreaker do
  use GenServer

  def start_link(name) do
    GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, %{failures: 0, state: :closed}, name: name)
  end

  def execute(name, fun) do
    GenServer.call(name, {:execute, fun})
  end

  def handle_call({:execute, fun}, _from, %{state: :open} = state) do
    {:reply, {:error, :circuit_open}, state}
  end

  def handle_call({:execute, fun}, _from, %{state: :closed, failures: failures} = state) do
    case fun.() do
      {:ok, result} ->
        {:reply, {:ok, result}, %{state | failures: 0}}

      {:error, reason} ->
        new_failures = failures + 1

        if new_failures >= 5 do
          {:reply, {:error, reason}, %{state | failures: new_failures, state: :open}}
        else
          {:reply, {:error, reason}, %{state | failures: new_failures}}
        end
    end
  end

  def handle_call(:reset, _from, _state) do
    {:reply, :ok, %{failures: 0, state: :closed}}
  end
end
```

### 4. Graceful Degradation

For critical operations, I added fallback mechanisms:

```elixir
def get_user_data(user_id) do
  case MyApp.CircuitBreaker.execute(:db_circuit, fn ->
    MyApp.User.get_by_id(user_id)
  end) do
    {:ok, user} -> user
    {:error, _} ->
      # Fallback: return cached data or minimal user info
      get_cached_user_data(user_id)
  end
end
```

### 5. Monitoring and Alerting

I added comprehensive monitoring to track database health:

```elixir
# Add to your Phoenix telemetry
:telemetry.attach(
  "my-app-db-connection-handler",
  [:my_app, :repo, :query],
  &MyApp.Telemetry.handle_event/4,
  nil
)

# Custom event handler
def handle_event([:my_app, :repo, :query], measurements, metadata, _config) do
  if measurements.total_time > 5000 do  # 5 seconds
    Logger.warning("Slow query detected",
      query_time: measurements.total_time,
      query: metadata.query
    )
  end
end
```

## Results

After implementing these changes:

- **99.9% uptime** during database maintenance windows
- **90% reduction** in 500 errors during connection failures
- **Faster recovery** when database connections are restored
- **Better user experience** with graceful error handling

## Key Takeaways

1. **Don't panic on the first failure** - implement retry logic with exponential backoff
2. **Protect your database** - use circuit breakers to prevent cascade failures
3. **Monitor everything** - track query performance and connection health
4. **Plan for failure** - have fallback mechanisms for critical operations
5. **Test your resilience** - simulate failures in your staging environment

This approach has saved us countless hours of debugging and significantly improved our application's reliability. The same principles apply to any database-backed application, regardless of the framework or database system you're using.
